# Vendor-Management-System-with-Performance-Metrics (Work in Progress)
# Objective : 
  Develop a Vendor Management System using Django and Django REST Framework. This system will handle vendor profiles, track purchase orders, and calculate vendor performance metrics.

# Project Status:
ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

As of now, I'm actively engaged in crafting and refining this system. Expect continuous updates and enhancements to bring about a feature-rich and reliable Vendor Management Solution.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute ideas or improvements. Your feedback is highly appreciated! Let's build something great together. ðŸš€
